			<p>Well, this was a very hard class! I knew it would be intense, but didn't realize just how intense. Now, what's really great about this course, even though its a lot to take in and in such a short amount of time. There was great resources and instructors. By far the most interactive instructors yet.</p>
			<p>Now, t say you can't learn anything in this class in such a small amount of time...is not entirely true. Given I have a small amount of time invested in coding, I learned LOTS! Even though it was brutal and the nights were long, I stuck with it. And, even though I'm not a 'professional' programmer, I can see a big leap from week to week.</p>
			<p>Thank you for all your help and all of the great knowledge!</p>
